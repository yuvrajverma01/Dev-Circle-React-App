# Dev Circle Web App

It's a social media app made with React.js + Redux + Styled Components and integrating it with Firebase. This project was Rafeh Qazi (Clever Programmer)

## About This Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][/public/screenshot.png]](https://devcircleapp.web.app/)

This is a social media application made in a very limited timeframe as a school project. It is capable to work exactly like [Linkedin](https://in.linkedin.com/) but except it only posts and retrieve your shared images or videos. Limited time frame :shipit:. But in order to understand a little about React.js, Redux and Styled Components - I made this project as to teach myself about these technologies. Why you should always take an easy or an intermediate project to learn new technologies?

Here's why:

- Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project focused to solve a problem and helps others or just a creative application.
- You shouldn't be iterating over the notes over and over again just to pass an exam from your school.
- You will gain an immense knowledge just by applying your knowledge into something rather than keeping it in your brain until newer technologies arrive.

This project was taught by the [Clever Programmer's Team](https://www.cleverprogrammer.com/) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqrILQNl5Ed9Dz6CGMyvMTQ). The way he creates his project repos incomplete so that the actual learning takes by implementing rather than copying is truly remarkable. :blush:
